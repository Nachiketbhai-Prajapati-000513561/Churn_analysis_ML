# Churn Analysis

Goal : To predict whether customer will churn or not in telecom industries
Dataset:- Churn Telecom(23 categorical variables)

majority : miniority class = 7.1 : 2.9 <br>
missing data : about 5% <br>
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

This dataset is imbalanced dataset where we need to predict two classes "Yes" or "No".
In the dataset, there are 71% majority class which is less than 80% so I decided to go with accuracy as evaluation metric.  
    
- Best Model parameters - {'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 4, 'min_child_weight': 5, 'n_estimators': 100, 'subsample': 0.7}       (XGBoost)
- Mean Cross validation score of Best model - 0.9281778380710121 (XGBoost)
- Test score of best model - 0.9317335945151812 (XGBoost)
- Train score of best model - 0.9323162818032666 (XGBoost)

## Dataset:-

Churn Telecom(23 categorical variables). There are total 50k+ rows and 58 columns in this dataset.
This dataset is imbalanced dataset where we need to predict two classes "Yes" or "No". In the dataset, there are 71% majority class which is less than 80% so I decided to go with accuracy as evaluation metric.

## Optimizations

Algorithm Efficiency:

If there were changes in algorithm logic to reduce complexity or make operations faster, such as replacing nested loops with vectorized operations (e.g., using NumPy or Pandas).
Data Processing:

Optimized data handling by using efficient libraries like Pandas, avoiding redundant computations, or caching results.
Memory Usage:

Implementations to handle large datasets efficiently, such as processing data in chunks or removing unused variables to free up memory.
Code Modularity:

Refactoring large code blocks into reusable functions for better readability and maintenance.
Library Usage:

Replacing manual implementations with optimized library functions (e.g., using sklearn for ML models or NumPy for mathematical operations).
Performance Improvements:

Usage of multiprocessing or parallel processing libraries to speed up execution.
Leveraging JIT compilation techniques (e.g., numba or cython).
Visualization Enhancements:

Optimizing plots by limiting data points, improving readability, or reducing rendering time for complex visualizations.
